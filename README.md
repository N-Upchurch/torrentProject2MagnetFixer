# TorrentProject2 Magnet Link Fixer

When searching for torrents, if you use the qBittorrent search plugins, you'll likely often wind up on torrentproject2.com. The problem is, when clicking the magnet link, you're redirected to a seemingly endless series of popups and ad-pages that you have to battle through before you can view the link. No more! This extension makes the magnet link actually give you the magnet link. Imagine that!

- Now also works on torrentproject.cc as of v1.1
